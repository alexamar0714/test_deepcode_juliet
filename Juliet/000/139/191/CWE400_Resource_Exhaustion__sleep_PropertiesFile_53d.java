 * CWE: 400 Resource Exhaustion
 * BadSource: PropertiesFile Read count from a .properties file (in property named data)
 * GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
 * Sinks:
 *    GoodSink: Validate count before using it as a parameter in sleep function
 *    BadSink : Use count as the parameter for sleep withhout checking it's size first
 * Flow Variant: 53 Data flow: data passed as an argument from one method through two others to a fourth; all four functions are in different classes in the same package
